           <a><a/><p><font color = "white">Those in the middle believe that we must earn our right to become interplanetary beings. They believe that terraforming Mars is a useful endeavor, but only if we first prove ourselves capable of transforming Earth into a sustainable planet, get our ecosystems back in balance, and change our culture to eschew greed and mindless consumerism.  To quote Shivika Sinha, author of The Ethics of Colonizing Mars:</font></p>
			  
            <p><font color = "white">“Do we see ourselves moving planet to planet, sucking life out of each one for our own survival?... Capitalism and consumerism have become the epitome of perpetuating systems that adversely turn our species parasitic. Consumption has increased the size of our landfills while decreasing the ethical standards we expect from businesses. Industry and mindless consumerism intertwined to create our current state. Now, they must disentangle and consumerism must lead industry out of planetary and ethical degradation.”</font></p>
			
            <p><font color = "white">Carl Sagan, astronomer and cosmologist, best known for popularizing science believes in terraforming Mars, but only if there is no life to be found there.  "If there is life on Mars, then I believe we should do nothing to disturb that life. Mars, then, belongs to the Martians, even if they are microbes."</font></p>
			
            <p><font color = "white">Similarly, Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA committed to biodiversity, believes that we must first explore Mars to ensure that there is no life on the planet, and if there is, remove ourselves and all that we brought to enable the native life to flourish.  McKay bases his ethical beliefs on three axioms – that human beings do not have special rights, that we are responsible to use nature in a responsible way, and that living systems have intrinsic worth even without human involvement.  He says,</font></p>
			
			
            <p><font color = "white">“If we discover living or dormant organisms on Mars and these forms represent a different type of life than the life we have on Earth, then we should not bring life from Earth to Mars. Instead, we should alter the Martian environment so that this native Martian life can expand to fill a planetary scale biosphere.”</font></p>
			
            <p><font color = "white">These ethical issues don’t deal with the costs in terms of money or resources involved in the possibility of terraforming Mars – and the issue of where that money and those resources may be better spent.</font></p>
