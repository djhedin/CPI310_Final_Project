CPI 310 final project

Install `nodemon` using npm with admin privileges before running `npm start`.
For best results I would recommend deleting the node_modules folder and running `npm install` to reinstall all modules for your specific operating system. The module Twig was not saved to the package.json and will need to be manually installed using `npm install twig`.
